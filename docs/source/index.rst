.. This is the core file for the Rosetta documentation.  It is
   automatically generated by sphinx-apidoc.  Do not edit this file
   directly.  Instead, edit the files in the Rosetta source tree and
   re-run `sphinx-apidoc`. To generate the HTML version of the doc,
   run `sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/`. This, in turn,
   has features to generate PDF/EPUB versions of the documentation.
   
   This toctree (table of contents tree) is required by Sphinx.
   Each file that should be included must be listed as document names
   (i.e. without file extension, using / as directory separators).
